How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It helped me by graphically showing the exact location where files have
    differences

    Diff output is very easy to understand, so, spotting the bug was a piece of cake.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Having access to the entire history of a file could save me a lot of time in
    refactoring process. Immediately spotting a change is extremely useful
    especially for files with lots of lines of code.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The pros are:
    - Absolute control over what it should be committed or not
    - Flexibility
    And the cons are:
    - If you forget to save a file with a lot of changes, probably
    you'll regret it
    - Too small changes are saved too

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Usually a software project has many files with multiple relationships, so it's
    really useful to have a tool that saves all of them using only one command.
    Google Docs treats each file separately because it makes sense 
    for rich-text files with no relationship between them.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log [--stat] will show the history of all commits, then with
    git diff oldfile newfile it's possible to find the differences beetwen the
    files

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
 could break something?

    If you break something, version control allows you to easily roll-back to a
    previous working version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Use it in my Python desktop application undegraduate project
