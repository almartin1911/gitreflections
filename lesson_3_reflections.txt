When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

	 When I feel comfortable to make my work public, or to have an online backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because I want to have control over deciding whether is necessary or not to
	update my local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

	A fork is basically a clone of a repo, but only exists in GitHub.
	A clone is a local copy of an existing local or online repo.
	A branch is a ramification of a project where one can make changes without
	affecting the stable version.

	I'd use a fork whenever I wanted to improve somebody else project without
	affecting it's original work. I'd clone instead of fork whenever I wanted
	to improve the original work, and then pull the changes to the author's
	repo.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It gives you the possibility of working offline. Also, you can check the
    differences between the offline and online version.
